# Class Project Links

Due to the liability of current and/or future students copying my work, my actual code files are in a private repository. I am more than happy to give access to this repository upon request, as long as you will not use or allow others to use this code (intentionally or not) for CSE courses offered at my school.


## Calendar
Link will be posted after grade for this project is finalized.

### Description

This project allows a user to register for an account and make events for any date they choose. It includes a dark mode that saves the preference for each registered user, alerts that appear when the user logs in for every event within 3 days, and important events are colored red. This was an opportunity to learn JavaScript and how to integrate it with PHP (and MySQL). My partner and I made this in roughly 28 hours. 

### Room for improvement:

Many, if not all, of these items were a necesseray calamity due to the time restriction for creating this project. Also there are certainly many more ways to improve, but these are ones that I find to be very noticable to the user and not requiring a fundamental change to the design of the code.
* Visuals show that shouldn't when the page first loads, but quickly disappear.
* Better user feedback (e.g. user doesn't know if they were registered unless they have the console pulled up)
