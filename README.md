# Class Project Links

Due to the liability of current and/or future students copying my work, my actual code files are in a private repository. I am more than happy to give access to this repository upon request, as long as you will not use or allow others to use this code (intentionally or not) for CSE courses offered at my school.

Link will be posted after grade for this project is finalized.

### Description

This project allows a user to register for an account and make events for any date they choose. It includes a dark mode that saves the preference for each registered user, alerts that appear when the user logs in for every event within 3 days, and important events are colored red. Usernames and passwords are salted and hashed for security (there were other security measures taken but this one was especially important). This was an opportunity to learn JavaScript and how to integrate it with PHP (and MySQL). My partner and I made this in roughly 28 hours. 

### Room for Improvement:

Many, if not all, of these items were a necesseray calamity due to the time restriction for creating this project. Also there are certainly many more ways to improve, but these are ones that I find to be very noticable to the user and not requiring a fundamental change to the design of the code.
* Visuals show that shouldn't when the page first loads, but quickly disappear.
* Better user feedback (e.g. user doesn't know if they were registered unless they have the console pulled up).

### Description

This project allows a user to view stories and comments posted by registered users. If a user wants to get access to these *awesome* features, they can register and login. Once logged in, the user can create, edit, and delete their posts. Each story has a title, content, and optional URL. Logged in users can also like stories and order the list of stories by date posted or likes. This was my first project integrating MySQL with PHP. Usernames and passwords are salted and hashed for security (there were other security measures taken but this one was especially important).

### Room for Impovement:

* The general look and layout could be greatly improved (but visuals were not the goal of this project).
* The text boxes for creating/editing titles, content, and comments could be increased in size for user readability.
* There are no client-side scripts so all updates are done by changing or refreshing pages, but again, the goal of this project was integrating MySQL with PHP. Ideally this overhaul would be made in future updates.
